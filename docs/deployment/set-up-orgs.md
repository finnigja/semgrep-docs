# Set up organizations

Organizations (orgs) in Semgrep enable users to share access to, and management of, Semgrep resources such as findings and reports.

Users can have more than one organization, and an organization can consist of one or many user accounts. Users must belong to at least one organization when they first sign in to Semgrep. 

For GitHub, GitLab, and SSO users: when deploying Semgrep for the first time, you'll be creating an organization for other team members to join when they first sign in. 

Organizations can be as small as a single department, or encompass whole companies.
