## Permissions and  access 

Ensure that you and your deployment team have sufficient permissions to:

- Add or make changes to CI jobs.
- Create access tokens in your source code manager.
- Commit files to all repositories you want Semgrep to scan.
- (Optional) View SSO configurations.
- (Optional) Set up channels in your chosen notification method (Slack, email, or webhooks).
- (For self-hosted repositories) Edit your firewall or VPN configuration's allowlist.

## Resources

Determine the following:

- What roles or departments will use Semgrep.
- The number of repositories you will scan with Semgrep.

## Processes

Determine the following:

- When you want to run a scan:
    - On a recurring schedule, such as daily or weekly. It is recommended to run Semgrep daily.
